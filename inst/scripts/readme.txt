Given that we are not allowed to redistribute ADNI data, we are simulating data based on the ADNI cross-sectional cortical thickness data generated by FreeSurfer (UCSF processed data 6.0).

Our data are generated to mimic real scanner and age effects.

Original ADNI data were downloaded on May29 2021, but are not provided in the current package.
